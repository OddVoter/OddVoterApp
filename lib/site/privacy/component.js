        <p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
        <p>(1) <strong>Federal Trade Commission Act</strong> (FTCA):</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The FTCA does not specifically require a privacy policy but it does have standards for when something would be considered a “deceptive trade practice.” </li>
          <li><strong>You will thus risk enforcement action if you fail to notify users:</strong></li>
            <ul>
              <li>Of information collection and sharing <strong>practices that are not obvious to</strong> an end user, e.g. automatic data collection not necessary to the site or apps functionality;</li>
              <li>Before <strong>using or disclosing information in a manner materially different than disclosed</strong> in a privacy policy;</li>
              <li>Before making <strong>material changes</strong> to a privacy policy.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <p>(2) In addition to the privacy policy, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) recommends that apps and websites have <strong>“just-in-time” privacy notices</strong> that require express consent before providing particularly sensitive information or before posting  on publicly viewable spaces.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>For OddVoter, this could look like a notice that pops up before someone posts a comment on a public board. The pop-up would require a click to agree to this statement “By posting this comment on a public board, I agree OddVoter does not have control over who views this information. See <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> for more information.”</li>
        </ul>
        <p>(3) Privacy policies needs to be <strong>easy to read and understandable language.</strong></p>
        <p>(4) The privacy policy needs to be <strong>apparent and easily accessible</strong> on the app and website.</p>
        <p>(5) Features that apply to, and should always apply to, your privacy policy include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Notice about what type of information is collected, how it will be collected, how it will be used, and if/when/how it will be shared.</li>
          <li>Choice and consent. Currently, the Terms of Service says “Please read the Terms of Service carefully because by using the OddVoter Website and Mobile Application...you accept and agree to be bound and abide by these Terms of Service.”</li>
          <li>A description of how users can access, change, or remove their personal information.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>(6) If you move forward with the advertising aspect of OddVoter and will be using online behavioral advertising (tracking a person’s cookies to place ads), then you will want to reference the standards for a privacy policy and user choice provided by the FTC’s “Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising” and the Digital Advertising Alliance’s (DAA) “Code of Conduct.” Links are provided here.</p>
